   It's been a rough year, and without any in person events we've lost the best part of the Contributor Summits - the Hallway Track. The Kubernetes Contributor Celebration is an attempt to reclaim that and celebrate our accomplishments. It's a time for us to relax, chat and do something fun with your fellow contributors!
